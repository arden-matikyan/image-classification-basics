# image-classification-basics
Image Classification on the Cifar-10 dataset using various classifiers. From Stanfords CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision

Each Jupyter Notebook demonstrates iterative development of respective classifiers, training, and testing. 

Classifiers implemented in cs231n/classifiers/. 


**Goals**

- Understand the basic **Image Classification pipeline** and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages).
- Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for **hyperparameter tuning**.
- Develop proficiency in writing efficient **vectorized** code with numpy.
- Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (**kNN**) classifier.
- Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (**SVM**) classifier.
- Implement and apply a **Softmax** classifier.
- Implement and apply a **Two layer neural network** classifier.
- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers.
- Get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations as opposed to raw pixels, e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features, etc.
